Follow Mouse Movement
In JavaScript, events are actions that happen on a web page. They can be anything from a mouse moving to a user typing in some text. Events happen to most elements on the DOM. These events are a good way to bind a code to user actions. For example, consider a web page that has a form with a "Submit" button. You can bind the mouse button click to that button and submit the form data upon that click.

Mouse events are a popular way to bind the DOM elements to events. Some of these events are as follows:

click: Triggered when the mouse is clicked
mousemove: Triggered when the mouse moves over an element
mouseleave: Triggered when mouse the leaves an element
In the starter code for this activity, the mouse movement event is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page. You can walk through the code to see how this all works.

You task is to add a second "eye" element and have that element follow the mouse position on the screen using the mouse events.
